## Problem Description and Goal

Tanzanian people have poor access to clean drinking water, which makes them to drink dirty water, and walk a lot to the closest functional water pump. Due to Tanzanian government's failure to fix this problem a big amount of water pumps are completely non-functioning or barely functional and also needing in repairing.

This is important task to solve, because our model can help Tanzanian government:

* to save money and time, and also think over the matter by providing the list of possible future non-working pumps.
* to predict which pumps are functional, which need some repairs, and which don't work at all.
* reduce the cost on workers, who have to drive and inspect every water pump in Tanzania.
* improve maintanance operations.
* understand if clean potable water is avaivable to Tanzanian habitants.
